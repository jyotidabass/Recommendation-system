    "The class of web applications that involve predicting user responses to options.  \n",

    "**Brief note about this document**\n",

    "*This will provide the intuition behind recommender systems. We will skip most of the gory math that drives building a recommendation system. The focus will be on applications.*\n",

    "#### Content-based Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation system is built on the metadata of the items.\n",

    "\n",
    "Set of factors, very specific to the domain, but not necessarily obvious or measured explicitly.\n",
